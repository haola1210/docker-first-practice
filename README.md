# **Docker research**

## **Run a single container:**
We can easyly run a single container for serving a service we need, such as a express server or react web app or database server and so on.
<br>
Just 3 simple step:
1.  create a docker file
2.  build an image from docker file
3.  run the container from the image
<br>

Tutorial which I followed is the Mosh's one.

## **Compose multiple container:**
We can run and manage many service with docker compose.

I noted a lot in docker compose file as comments.
